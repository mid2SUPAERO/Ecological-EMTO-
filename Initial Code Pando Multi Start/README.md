# Code Pando Multi Start

This code has been develloped by E.Duriez to obtain the lowest compliance. In the code we specify some intial designes (cubicity etc) and the solver is going to optimize our structure on the basis of these intitial designs for each of it. After our solver looks for the lowest compliance between our initial design. So, by this way we can obtain the most optimized structure.

Initial designs are specified in the file top88DesignMBB.m starting with the line 46
